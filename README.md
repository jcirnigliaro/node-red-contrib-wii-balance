node-red-contrib-wii-balance
============================

Node-Red nodes for bluetooth communication with Wii Balance Board

This is a thin node-red wrapper around [wii-balance-board-pi](https://github.com/JohannesMerkt/wii-balance-board-pi)
You will need to hit the small red sync button in the balance board's battery compartment before each use.
This has only been tested on a Raspberry Pi 3b. 

Install
-------

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

    npm install node-red-contrib-wii-balance
